Energy conservation from efficiency-oriented policies could be undermined by the so-called "rebound effect" (RE). To accurately estimate the RE in China's residential electricity consumption, this study exploits a stochastic electricity demand frontier approach based on panel data covering 278 cities in China. The main results show that the average residential electricity efficiency is 0.9502, while 48.88% of the energy-saving from efficiency improvement is offset due to the RE. We also find that the RE increases rapidly during the sample period and is distributed dispersedly in China's regions. Specifically, cities with advanced economic development tend to have higher electricity efficiency as well as a more significant RE. Regarding the impact factors, the electricity price has no significant effect on electricity demand under the imperfect market mechanism, but it plays an important role in limiting the RE. This situation remains unchanged after the implementation of the tiered pricing of household electricity policy in 2012. In addition, we find that residential income, population density, and temperature deviation are vital determinants of residential electricity consumption, whereas household size significantly impacts the RE. The empirical findings imply that efficiency policies should be designed and implemented accordingly in different regions while considering the RE.
